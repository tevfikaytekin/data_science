    "\n",
    "Finding nearest neighbors in a set of objects is a very general problem which has applications in many areas. If the size of the set of objects is very large then an exhaustive search can be very costly. In those cases approximate nearest neighbor techniques can be used. These techniques do not guarantee to find all the nearest neighbors but instead give some probabilistic guaranties. This implies that not all nearest neighbors will be returned and some not so nearest neigbors might appear in the returned list. But the gain is that these methods are much faster than their exhaustive versions. LSH is one such popular method.\n"

    "For every distance metric (such as cosine, Jaccard, hamming, etc.) you should define a LSH family of hash functions (note that for some distance metrics this may not be possible). For cosine distance sign of the dot product of the data point with a random unit vector is used for construction the LSH. Each such random unit vector constitutes a different function in the LSH family F. The following figure illustrates why dot product with a random unit vector can be used to build an LSH family of function for cosine distance. \n",

The equation gives the probability of the sign of the dot product of $r$ witg vectors $a$ and $b$. The figure above can be used for the proof. The arcs show the regions of $r$ where the dot product with $a$ or $b$ is positive. If $r$ is in the insersecting region $(180-\\alpha)$ of the arcs then the signs will be the same. Hence we can conclude that the probability of this to happen is $\\frac{180-\\alpha}{180}$\n",

The dominating cost in exhaustive search is the matrix multiplication operation which is done using numpy's dot() function which implemented in C. So the above running time results do not reflect the true capacity of LSH (which should be better). In order to make a fair comparison it would be better to write everything in C/C++."
