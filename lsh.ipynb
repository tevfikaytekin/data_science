If the size of the set of objects is very large then an exhaustive search can be very costly. In those cases approximate nearest neighbor techniques can be used. These techniques do not guarantee to find all the nearest neighbors but instead give some probabilistic guaranties. This implies that not all nearest neighbors will be returned and some not so nearest neighbors might appear in the returned list. But the gain is that these methods are much faster than their exhaustive versions.

The arcs show the regions of $r$ where the dot product with $a$ or $b$ is positive. If $r$ is in the insersecting region $(180-\\alpha)$ of the arcs then the signs will be the same.

False positives are cases where two dissimilar items map to the same bucket. False negatives are cases where two similar items map to different buckets. As the number of bands increases the possibility of false negatives will decrease and as the size of the signatures increases the possiblity of false positives will decreases.\n"," \n","By changing the values of $b$ (number og bands) and $r$ (number of rows) one can adjust the ratio of false negatives and false positives. Given that the probability of the signature values of two items to agree in any one particular row is $s$, the probability of becoming a candidate pair is $1 - (1 - s^r)^b$ which can be calculated as below:\n","\n","Given two items:\n","\n","- The probability that signatures agree in all rows of a particular band is $s^r$\n","- The probability that signatures disagree in at least one row of a particular band is $1-s^r$\n","- The probability that signatures disagree in at least one row of each of the bands is ($1-s^r)^b$\n","- The probability that signatures agree in all rows of at least one band (that is, they become a candidate pair is $1 - (1 -
