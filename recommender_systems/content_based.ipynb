Since its inception in 1992, GroupLens's research projects have explored a variety of fields including:\n","\n","* recommender systems\n","* online communities\n","* mobile and ubiquitious technologies\n","* digital libraries\n","* local geographic information systems\n","\n","GroupLens Research operates a movie recommender based on collaborative filtering, MovieLens, which is the source of these data. We encourage you to visit <http://movielens.org> to try it out! If you have exciting ideas for experimental work to conduct on MovieLens, send us an email at <grouplens-info@cs.umn.edu> - we are always interested in working with external collaborators.\n","\n","\n","Content and Use of Files\n","========================\n","\n","Formatting and Encoding\n","-----------------------\n","\n","The dataset files are written as [comma-separated values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files with a single header row. Columns that contain commas (`,`) are escaped using double-quotes (`\"`). These files are encoded as UTF-8. If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. Misérables, Les (1995)) display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the data, such as a text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for UTF-8.\n","\n","\n","User Ids\n","--------\n","\n","MovieLens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have been anonymized. User ids are consistent between `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same user across the two files).\n","\n","\n","Movie Ids\n","---------\n","\n","Only movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset. These movie ids are consistent with those used on the MovieLens web site (e.g., id `1` corresponds to the URL <https://movielens.org/movies/1>). Movie ids are consistent between `ratings.csv`, `tags.csv`, `movies.csv`, and `links.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same movie across these four data files).\n","\n","\n","Ratings Data File Structure (ratings.csv)\n","-----------------------------------------\n","\n","All ratings are contained in the file `ratings.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:\n","\n","    userId,movieId,rating,timestamp\n","\n","The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.\n","\n","Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).\n","\n","Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.\n","\n","\n","Tags Data File Structure (tags.csv)\n","-----------------------------------\n","\n","All tags are contained in the file `tags.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the following format:\n","\n","    userId,movieId,tag,timestamp\n","\n","The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.\n","\n","Tags are user-generated metadata about movies. Each tag is typically a single word or short phrase. The meaning, value, and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.\n","\n","Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.\n","\n","\n","Movies Data File Structure (movies.csv)\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","Movie information is contained in the file `movies.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:\n","\n","    movieId,title,genres\n","\n","Movie titles are entered manually or imported from <https://www.themoviedb.org/>, and include the year of release in parentheses. Errors and inconsistencies may exist in these titles.\n","\n","Genres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:\n","\n","* Action\n","* Adventure\n","* Animation\n","* Children's\n","* Comedy\n","* Crime\n","* Documentary\n","* Drama\n","* Fantasy\n","* Film-Noir\n","* Horror\n","* Musical\n","* Mystery\n","* Romance\n","* Sci-Fi\n","* Thriller\n","* War\n","* Western\n","* (no genres listed)\n","\n","\n","Links Data File Structure (links.csv)\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","Identifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data are contained in the file `links.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:\n","\n","    movieId,imdbId,tmdbId\n","\n","movieId is an identifier for movies used by <https://movielens.org>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <https://movielens.org/movies/1>.\n","\n","imdbId is an identifier for movies used by <http://www.imdb.com>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/>.\n","\n","tmdbId is an identifier for movies used by <https://www.themoviedb.org>.

We no longer bundle either of these features with the dataset, since most modern toolkits provide this as a built-in feature.
